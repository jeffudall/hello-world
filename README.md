Hola!

Mi llamo, Jefe. Estoy Estados Unideos. Mi hablo espanio muy bueno - NO!

Hello, world, 

I hope you are doing well. The USA is not feeling very good right now. We've caught a disease called Trump and nobody will do anything about getting us any better so we are just going to have to stay in bed until the 2018 election. 

Sorry for ruining everything the 20th century worked so hard to build!

Best,

Jeff
